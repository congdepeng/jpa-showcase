# Java Persistence API


## 1. Why use JPA?
### 1.1 JDBC
If you have some experiences in J2EE development, you should known Java Database Connectivity(JDBC) which is a Java-based data access technology.
This technology is an API for the Java programming language that defines how a client may access a database.

### 1.2 What's ORM?
But programming with JDBC is boring and very error prone, you need to write down the SQLs for data management.
Object-relational mapping (ORM, O/RM, and O/R mapping) in computer software is a programming technique for converting data between incompatible type systems in object-oriented programming languages.
This creates, in effect, a "virtual object database" that can be used from within the programming language.
There are both free and commercial packages available that perform object-relational mapping, although some programmers opt to create their own ORM tools.

### 1.3 JPA
The Java Persistence API, aka JPA, is a Java programming interface specification which describes the management of relational data in applications.

### 3.1 Entities
An entity is a lightweight persistence domain object. Typically an entity represents a table in a relational database, and each entity instance corresponds to a row in that table. The primary programming artifact of an entity is the entity class, although entities can use helper classes.
The persistent state of an entity is represented either through persistent fields or persistent properties. These fields or properties use object/relational mapping annotations to map the entities and entity relationships to the relational data in the underlying data store.


Requirements for Entity Classes
An entity class must follow these requirements:

- The class must be annotated with the javax.persistence.Entity annotation.
- The class must have a public or protected, no-argument constructor. The class may have other constructors.
- The class must not be declared final. No methods or persistent instance variables must be declared final.
- If an entity instance be passed by value as a detached object, such as through a session bean’s remote business interface, the class must implement the Serializable interface.
- Entities may extend both entity and non-entity classes, and non-entity classes may extend entity classes.
- Persistent instance variables must be declared private, protected, or package-private, and can only be accessed directly by the entity class’s methods. Clients must access the entity’s state through accessor or business methods.
